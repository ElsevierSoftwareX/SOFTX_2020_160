First version of online developed by Igor Yakusin and modifiedf by Marco Drago

Changed setting:

- Remind to set an enviroment variable
  export CWB = PATHDIR 

- the bin directory should be put in /home/$USER because it is called from many files

- the *.sh files in RUN_CWB directory contains the definition of the local path that should be changed

--------------------------------------------

the configuration file for online is the cWB_conf.py, while the user_parameters.C is in RUN_cWB/config directory

to create a new directory (zero lag only), use the command:
./cwb_online.sh cWB_conf.py

Then run the script in :
- run.crontab for zero lag
- web.crontab for preparation of web pages
